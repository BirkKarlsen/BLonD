WARNINGS FOR THE USER
=====================

1) If you have your distribution for (beam.theta, beam.dE) from file, construct
   a Beam class, overwrite the coordinates in it with your distribution and
   then add immediately after these two following lines:
   		beam.theta = numpy.ascontiguousarray(beam.theta)
   		beam.dE = numpy.ascontiguousarray(beam.dE) 
   Example:
   		beam = Beam(general_params, N_p, N_b)
		beam.theta, beam.dE = numpy.loadtxt('../Input/initial_long_distr.dat', 
											unpack=True)
		beam.theta = numpy.ascontiguousarray(beam.theta)
		beam.dE = numpy.ascontiguousarray(beam.dE)
		
2)  You have to launch the setup_cpp.py file; change the options inside if 
    necessary. 
    
3) There have been a lot of changes with version 1.11.0 (see README.md for details); the input files
   used for previous versions of the code won't work anymore and should be readapted; please check
   the example main files to have a reference point.
